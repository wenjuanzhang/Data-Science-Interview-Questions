# Data-Science-Interview-Questions
A list of interview questions
1. Given a dataset with 1000 datapoints following a Gaussian distribution, how do you find that distribution?
   - Answer: mean and variance.
2. **Data drift monitor** You have last year and this year's data, how do you tell whether the data follow the same distributions, i.e. whether you need to retrain the model which was built on ? Multivariate situation
   - Answer: 
3. **Sample size** Given a binary classification problem, how do you decide many data you need to collect? 
   - Answer: 
4. **Feature selection** Given 25 features X and one response variable Y, how do you select the most important two features? (Non-PCA methods)
   - Answer: 

5. Missing values, how do you deal with 10% or more missing values? How do you check whether there is bias due to missing values encoding? check target variable with missing variables. 
6. Why glm doesn't have a problem with 0 values?
7. Why is there a upper bound on the R2 for any model fitting on the loss? because the real data has randomness, the error term.
8. How many policies have zero losses? 80%? 
9. Why Lasso regression eliminates variables? L1 norm of model coefficients are penalty terms used to . 
10. Highly correlated variables: why one may want to remove correlated variables from modeling procedure? Redundant information, additional error/variation included, harm the model performance.
